This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Sanity Content Studio](https://www.sanity.io/).

## Getting Started

Run the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend-next
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Run the frontend development server:

```bash
cd backend-sanity
sanity start
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the schemas by modifying `schemas/schema.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
